# player-tracker
Design and Implementation - A player tracking system that allows users to store and view player details which includes their nationality, club team and age. Additionally, there is a functionality for logging game stats like minutes, goals and assists which are then displayed along with the aforementioned player details. Thus, there was the design of both a player service, game service and query service that ties both together.

Utility - Provides a very simple way to keep track of players that you wish to follow with functionality that can be customizable to one’s need. Imagine you are a youth scout for an English division 1 soccer club. There aren’t too many data sources available for you to view the player and game details of youth prospects. This is where player-tracker can be beneficial to you as it provides a relatively simple way to add and view player details. You might have to share this service with other scouts but that isn’t a problem as the players have been categorized by age so you can focus on the prospects that matter to you. If you have been given the task of finding homegrown talent, then you are in luck as the service color codes the players belonging to the country of your domestic league. Let’s say you want to see the value in these players, you can do that easily by logging the games you view and see that update real time in the player card. Unsure on deciding between 2 players, well the service provides each player’s best performance which hopefully makes that decision easier for you.
